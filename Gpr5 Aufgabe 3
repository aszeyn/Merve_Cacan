# Substring Search Program

The Python program uses indexing, slicing, and loops to look for a substring (needle) within a main string (haystack).

# How to Use:

1. Execute the program using a Python interpreter.
2. Input the substring (needle) as prompted.
3. Provide the main string (haystack) when prompted.
4. The program will show where the substring first appears in the main string.
